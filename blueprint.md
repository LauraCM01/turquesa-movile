# Project Blueprint: Hotel Room Management App

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a Flutter application to manage hotel room reservations, as requested. The app will feature a detailed view of a reservation, including guest information and the ability to change the room's status.

## 2. Core Features & Design

- **Reservation Details Screen:** A central screen displaying all information for a specific room reservation.
- **Visual Design:** The UI will be modeled after the provided image, featuring a clean layout, custom fonts, and a specific color scheme.
- **State Management:** The application will use the `provider` package to manage the room's status (e.g., Occupied, Available, Cleaning, Maintenance), allowing for dynamic updates to the UI.
- **Component-Based Structure:** The UI will be built with reusable widgets for better organization and maintainability.

## 3. Development Plan

### Step 1: Project Setup & Dependencies
- Create a new Flutter project.
- Add necessary dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`:
  - `provider` for state management.
  - `google_fonts` for custom typography.

### Step 2: Application Structure
- **`main.dart`**: The main entry point. It will set up the `ChangeNotifierProvider` for state management and define the application's theme.
- **`lib/providers/room_provider.dart`**: A class that will manage the state of the room, including the current status.
- **`lib/screens/room_details_screen.dart`**: The main screen widget that will display the reservation details.
- **`lib/models/room_status.dart`**: An enum to define the possible room statuses.
- **`lib/widgets/`**: A directory for reusable UI components (e.g., status card, info list).

### Step 3: UI Implementation
- **Screen Layout:** Build the main layout with a `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and a `SingleChildScrollView` for the body.
- **Image:** Add the hotel room image with rounded corners.
- **Reservation Info:** Display the reservation number, guest details, and other relevant information.
- **Status Display:** Create a dynamic card that shows the current room status and changes based on the state managed by `RoomProvider`.
- **Status Changer:** Implement a dialog or bottom sheet that allows the user to select a new status for the room.
- **Navigation:** Add a bottom navigation bar for potential future navigation between different sections of the app.

### Step 4: Styling and Polish
- **Colors & Fonts:** Apply the color scheme and typography from the design using `ThemeData` and `google_fonts`.
- **Icons:** Use appropriate Material Design icons.
- **Layout & Spacing:** Ensure all elements are well-spaced and aligned for a clean, polished look.

### Step 5: Testing & Refinement
- Perform manual testing to ensure all UI elements work as expected.
- Verify that the state management correctly updates the UI.
- Refine the layout and styling based on testing feedback.
